Problem 6A: Computer Word Choose

best case:
call get_perms(hand, len(hand)) within a loop checking the return is in the word_list
if it's not then call get_perms(hand, len(hand -1)) until you find the largest word within the list
this search is very inefficient, need to reduce the search space
